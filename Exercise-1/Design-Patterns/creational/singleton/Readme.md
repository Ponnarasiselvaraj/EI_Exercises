# Singleton Pattern

 ðŸ“Œ Category

Creational Pattern

## ðŸ“– Overview
The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## ðŸ’¡ Use Case in This Project
The **Singleton Pattern** is used to implement a **Clipboard**:
- Only one clipboard instance is allowed across the system.
- This ensures consistent copy-paste operations and avoids multiple conflicting clipboards.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Main.java` â€“ Demonstrates Singleton clipboard usage.
- `Clipboard.java` â€“ Singleton class providing global access to the clipboard instance.

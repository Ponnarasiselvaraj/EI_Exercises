# Singleton Pattern

 📌 Category

Creational Pattern

## 📖 Overview
The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## 💡 Use Case in This Project
The **Singleton Pattern** is used to implement a **Clipboard**:
- Only one clipboard instance is allowed across the system.
- This ensures consistent copy-paste operations and avoids multiple conflicting clipboards.

## 📂 Files
- `Main.java` – Demonstrates Singleton clipboard usage.
- `Clipboard.java` – Singleton class providing global access to the clipboard instance.

## 🖼️ Sample Output
Running `Main.java` shows that only one clipboard instance is used:

# Strategy Pattern

ðŸ“Œ Category

Behavioral Pattern

## ðŸ“– Overview
The **Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.  
It allows the behavior of a class to change dynamically without modifying the client.

## ðŸ’¡ Use Case in This Project
Here, the **Strategy Pattern** is used for a **Video Player** to support multiple playback quality modes:
- High Quality
- Standard Quality
- Low Quality  



This makes it easy to switch between video quality strategies at runtime without changing the player logic.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Main.java` â€“ Demonstrates usage of the strategies.
- `VideoPlayer.java` â€“ Context class that uses a strategy.
- `VideoQualityStrategy.java` â€“ Strategy interface.
- `HighQualityStrategy.java` â€“ Concrete strategy for high quality.
- `StandardQualityStrategy.java` â€“ Concrete strategy for standard quality.
- `LowQualityStrategy.java` â€“ Concrete strategy for low quality.
